The world population is increasing and will, by 2050, nearly double its demand for food, feed, fuel, and fiber. Be-sides environmental challenges, labor shortage also poses crucialchallenges to the agricultural production system. Automationof manual tasks in crop production can potentially increaseefficiency but also lead to a change in agricultural practices formore effective usage of available land. In this work, we addressthe problem of robotic fruit harvesting in challenging real-worldscenarios such as vertical farms, where robotic sensing andacting need to cope with a cluttered environment. Robotic fruitharvesting is typically done by directly detecting a grasp pointin the sensor reading, which can lie on the fruit itself or on itspeduncle depending on crop harvesting requirements. However,grasp point detection is not always possible as the ideal grasppoint may be hidden behind leaves or other fruits. Our approachexploits shape completion techniques allowing us to estimate thecomplete 3D shape of a target fruit together with its pose evenunder strong occlusions. In this way, we can estimate a grasppoint even when the fruit is only partially visible. We evaluate ourapproach on a real robotic manipulator operating in a verticalfarm growing different fruit species and employing differentharvesting tools. Our experiments show that, on average, ourproposed pipeline increases the success rate by 18.5 percentagepoints, in terms of end-effector positioning, compared to the mostcompetitive baseline among the ones reported in this work, thatdoes not rely on shape completion.
